* Each player can have either of these points in one game 0 15 30 40
* If you have 40 and you win the ball you win the game, however there are special rules.
* If both have 40 the players are deuce.
* If the game is in deuce, the winner of a ball will have advantage and game ball.
* If the player with advantage wins the ball he wins the game
* If the player without advantage wins they are back at deuce.
